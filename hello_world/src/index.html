      the main function is a special type of function in cairo and is always the
      first to run in every excutable cairo program.

    <p>
      The line use debug::PrintTrait; is responsible for importing an item
      defined in another module. In this case, we are importing the PrintTrait
      item from the Cairo core library. By doing so, we gain the ability to use
      the print() method on data types that are compatible with printing.
